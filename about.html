					The purpose of this is to fulfill a class requirement,
					but to also learn a little more about how things work <br>
					in the developement space with Github. I don't have any
					previous experience with sharing work like this so it's <br>
					interesting to see the processes behind it. On the 'Other Info' page,
					you'll see a very basic FizzBuzz program <br>
					I created to share
					for this project. <br>
